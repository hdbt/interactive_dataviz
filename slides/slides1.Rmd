## Interactive Data Visualization

-   Most popular and best documented frames are Plotly, Highcharts, leaflet
      -   all of them are based in JavaScript.
      -   luckily you dont need to know JS, as customizing is mostly done in wrappers for various languages (R, Python, ...)
      -   interactivity needs can only be achieved, where you can run JS. That's why HTML documents is the Goldstandard
      -   There are a ton of ways to share your work
          -     Save your Work as a HTML document (and embed it in your website). 
          -     write in a RMD document and then render to ioslides or slidy (creats also an HTML document)
          -     write a shiny app and deploy to shinyclouds (or own server)
-   Plotly is the most popular and easiest to work with. 
-   Highcharts is less known, relatively customizable and free to use in non comercial settings
-   leaflet is great for interactive maps

## What is Shiny?

> [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a framework for
> creating web applications using R code.
> It is designed primarily with data scientists in mind, and to that
> end,
> you can create pretty complicated Shiny apps with no knowledge of
> HTML,
> CSS, or JavaScript.
> On the other hand, Shiny doesn't limit you to creating trivial or
> prefabricated apps: its user interface components can be easily
> customized or extended, and its server uses reactive programming to
> let
> you create any type of back end logic you want.
> Shiny is designed to feel almost magically easy when you're getting
> started, and yet the deeper you get into how it works, the more you
> realize it's built out of general building blocks that have strong
> software engineering principles behind them.

-   Package for creating web-apps

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(shiny)

```

-   Gives you easy Framework for deploying interactive R Code to
    everbody, without learning any other language than R

    -   you write the R code and shiny creates the app

    -   But if you know some HTML,CSS or JS you can easily utilize this.
        (easy to learn anyway)

    -   interactive app, that takes inputs from the user and updates the
        outputs accordingly

-   Every shiny app consists of three components

    -   Userinterface (UI) = The body of your app
    -   Server => The brain of your app
    -   reactives => The central nervous system of your app

## Shiny Examples

</iframe>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://nsgrantham.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdayrocks/">https://hdbt.shinyapps.io/translate/</iframe>

## Basic Structure

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  "Hello, world!"
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
}

shinyApp(ui, server)

```

## App Structure

Shiny applications have two components

### UI

User interface for placing and displaying inputs(e.g. scroll bars,
buttons) and outputs (e.g. plot)

-   Controls layout and appearance of your app

-   add HTML widgets

-   Every shiny app consists of three components

### Server

Server functions include everything you would normally to do your
analysis, but include reactives.

-   code your analysis

-   connect code to your UI via reactive functions

## Reactives

Reactive functions are something between variables (cold/static) and a
function (hot/dynamic) => a function with memory.

First time called: run like a function Second time called: read from
cache (if nothing changed)

Example:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(shiny)
dataset <- reactive({ data(mtcars) })
dataset()
```

Reactives are the magic sprinkles, that deal with the communication
between the UI and the Server. Web developers call this concept
"callback". Usually a tedious experience, but shiny manages this almost
automatically for you. This is the major USP of shiny (taking care of
the dependencies).

## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a collection of HTML Conventions, CSS Styles, & JavaScript
Snippets provided in a convenient form

-   originally developed by Twitter, but a popular CSS Frameworks

-   also used in R-Package Websites or R Markdown converted HTML

-   generated automatically by Shiny - takes HTML Arguments (class, etc.
    ) in UI

-   highly customizable like any website - use themes provided by
    bs_theme (we'll look at this later)

-   Make your life easier with
    [bootstraplib](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/bootstraplib/versions/0.1.0.9000)

-   functions for easy changes in style + an interactive styling app w/
    code generator

<!-- -->

-   it's possible to use other frameworks than bootstrap

    -   see
        [nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions](https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions)
        for an extensive collection of helpful packages for all kind of
        topics

## Layout, Themes & HTML

Provides high-level ( high-level = less complex, low-level = more
complex) visual structure

Hierarchy of function calls (Waterfall principle + nested)

fluid page, fixed page or fill page ---> provides basis HTML and CSS
structure (skeleton)

more complex customization need "Layout functions" are nested inside
fluidpage

## Dashboards

-   [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/
)  Maintained by RStudio Developers Team. Well suited for shiny apps. 
    -   written as shiny app 
```{r echo=TRUE, eval= FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(shinydashboardPlus) # bonus features. 
```
    

-   [flexdashboard](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html) if you only want to run RMD Documents or if you want to mix content like this dashboard. But its also possible to run shiny by adding <b> runtime: shiny</b> to YAML
    -   written in a RMD document 
```{r echo=TRUE, eval= FALSE}

# Second Session

## Advanced Topics and pointers

-   HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Reactive expressions

eventReactive minimize dependencies Render --> for looks/output observe
--> for sideffects( downloadhandler, read data from disc, ....)

observeEvent = observe({x, isolate(y)}) decouples from listening to
action

## Deploying your App to the Web

1.  Go to <https://www.shinyapps.io> and create an account or log in
    with Google/GitHub

2.  Follow the instructions for connecting your machine to the server.

3.  Publish!
